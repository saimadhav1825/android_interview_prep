        }
		
private val myBoundServiceConnection = object : ServiceConnection {
        override fun onServiceConnected(p0: ComponentName?, binder: IBinder?) {
            val myBoundServiceBinder = binder as MyBoundService.MyServiceBinder
            myBoundService = myBoundServiceBinder.gerService()
            isBound = true
        }
